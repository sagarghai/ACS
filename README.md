<!-- For the Acs Lab Website -->

frameworks used:
HTML5 Boilerplate -> a template framework for html5 projects.
Bootstrap -> a set of prewritten css files for styling of webpages using classes and ids.

folderview:
css --> contains all css files.
img --> contains images  (wheneever you include an image it must be put in here and properly referenced)
	: the size of the i.e the axb pixels must be maintained in order for the look of the website
js --> conatins all javascript files used.
doc --> contains any ohter files/pdfs/txt/videos/ to be included in the website.

Work needed :
home page : images need to be cropped and footer information needs to be changed
infrastructure page : i have made a dummy element for kinnect, now you can only change the text and images and add more elements.Read instructions in comments
projects and downloads needs to be made from body but i have already included the base template.

The further development can be done using panel and bootstrap.
Thank you.
